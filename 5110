<p><i>“I am a person of many talents but nothing seems to stick up… or maybe I am just indecisive, that could be it! Blame the indecisiveness” … <font color="#CC00FF">Villa Vance</font></i></p>
<h2><strong>Video Presentation</strong></h2>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7hDW3go-pk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>M.S. in Learning Technologies</strong></h2>
<p>- with specialization in Instructional Systems and Instructional Design</p>


<p><strong>Courses I have taken so far: </strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>CECS5300 :</strong> Learning & Cognition</li>
<li><strong>CECS5030 :</strong> Foundations of Learning Technologies</li>
<li><strong>CECS5420 :</strong> Web Authoring</li>
<li><strong>CECS5570 :</strong> Ethical, Legal & Professional Issues in Computing</li>
<li><strong>CECS5110 :</strong> Multimedia in  Technology Applications – in    progress</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2><strong>Goal as a STUDENT</strong></h2>
<p>As a student I strived to learn as much as I could. If I can apply and teach 
somebody the things I’ve learn from an individual and add my own teachings, then I believed I
’ve learned the concept/idea. Learning is a process of knowing and applying what you learned and know. I have always been fascinated with designs and I love the idea of being able to create something and other people can use and benefit from it.</p>
<h2><strong>Goal as a PROFESSIONAL</strong></h2>
<p>As a professional I want to keep growing and be able to apply the knowledge I have learned throughout my course of study and the experiences I have developed throughout the years. My current career has encouraged me to pursue my masters in order to move forward. With the master’s program, I believed it will train and get me ready for the career I am looking to achieving.
The training and experiences I am getting now hopefully will help me explore more about using technology to teach and it will make learning better. Furthermore, I love the idea of using technology to create better and interactive instructions so others can benefit from it.</p>

<h2><strong>Multimedia Educational Technology Statement</strong></h2>
<p>Computer and technology had become essential in the learning process in many ways. Although there are still a lot of people that will argue that technology can have a negative impact in the socialization and critical thinking of children, adolescents and even adult learners, they are still necessary and very important tools for classroom and the workplace. It can also foster greater knowledge and usability in understanding of things that is happening in the world. </p>

<p>According to Symonds (2000) technology is a critical tool in improving student learning. He further stated that the quality of public education can become better by using the web to tailor the instructions according to the need of the learner, creating a chance for instructor to participate in collaborateral support through e-mail, and giving better home-school communication via e-mail and through the web.</p>
<p>I believe that the type of media used in creating instructional instructions greatly influence how the learner will retain the information. Although this was opposed by Clark after he did the review of a <i>"comparative research on educational media and claimed that they provide consistent evidence"</i>. He further stated that <i>"...media are mere vehicles that deliver instruction but do not influence student achievement anymore than the truck that delivers our groceries causes changes in our nutrition."</i>  Kozma (1994) however believe that <i>"as we have come to understand, learning is not the receptive response instruction's delivery. Rather, learning is an active, constructive, cognitive and social process by which the learner strategically manages available cognitive, physical, and social resources to create new knowledge by interacting with information in the environment and integrating it with information already stored in memory (Shuell, 1988)"</i> and I think that Kozma is right on that claimed.</p>
